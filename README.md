---

## Description

For this project, we were tasked to create our own adventure based on a topic given. This project is created for two main reasons. The first being practing linking. For a while now, we have been learning how to link files together, in different ways. Now, it is time to showcase what we had discovered. The second being collaboration. In order to be sucessful, we need to know how to work with each other efficently. This project will push us to use both of these skills we improved in.
